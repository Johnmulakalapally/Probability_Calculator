# Python Probability Calculator
### This project is to build a calculator regarding probability in python.
Probability calculator finds the probability of an event occurring by calculating the ratio of the favorable outcomes to the total outcomes. Probability is a field of statistics that is used to describe the likelihood of occurrence of an event.
Here I declare the balls with respect to theire colors. I have taken 4 blue, 2 red and 6 green balls.
from those balls i want to pick 4 balls that contains 2 blue and 1 red balls. 1
Here we can iterate the color of balls based on number of balls with respect to the color then append the color to an empty list.
Computer randomly selects different colors from list. Each experiment is to compare those colors with what i want to get as my output colors. 
If they match,our experments is successfull or else it ia not successfull.
Continuouesly repeat the process many times 
we can calculate probability.
probability=number of success experiments/total experiments
