# Project:Probability Calculator
Probability calculator finds the probability of an event occurring by calculating the ratio of the favorable outcomes to the total outcomes. Probability is a field of statistics that is used to describe the likelihood of occurrence of an event.

Here I declare the balls with respect to theire colors. I have taken 4 blue, 2 red and 6 green balls.
from those balls i want to pick 4 balls that contains 2 blue and 1 red balls. 
here we can iterate the color of ball based on number of balls with respect to the color, and append the color to an empty list.
computer randomly selects colors from list Each experiment and compare those colors with what i want the output balls colors. if they are match our experments is success otherwise not.
continuouesly repeat the process upto number of experiments. after completion of number of experiments 
we can calculate probability.
probability=number of success experiments/total experiments
